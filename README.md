# Movie_Recommender_System

This project is a content-based movie recommender system that uses cosine similarity and vectorization to recommend movies based on plot summaries.
The system is built using scikit-learn and numpy libraries, and uses the TMDB 5000 movies dataset for movie information.

#Anyone who wants to understand how recommendation system works, this code will help them who have basic python knowledge, i tried my best to comment on code to give better understanding for beginners
